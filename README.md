# XAS_fitting

#### This ipython notebook take X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) data and fit the spectra with Lorentzian functions.

#### How to use:
1. Prepare your XAS sample data in the same directory.
2. Specify the number of peaks in the head of the script. Eg. N_{4,5} for Actinide has two peaks.
3. Run the application and check the fitting results.


XAS Data will be available upon request after the publication of "Hybridization effect on the X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy from Actinide Materials: Application to PuB4" by W.-T. Chiu, G. Resta, T.-H. Lee, E. D. Bauer, F. Ronning, R T. Scalettar, and J.-X. Zhu.

# XAS_fitting

#### This ipython notebook take X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) data and fit the spectra with Lorentzian functions.

#### How to use:
1. Prepare your XAS sample data in the same directory.
2. Specify the number of peaks in the head of the script. Eg. N_{4,5} for Actinide has two peaks.
3. Run the application and check the fitting results.
